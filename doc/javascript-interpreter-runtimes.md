# FOSS JavaScript interpreters and runtimes

Implementing the relevant standards of JavaScript fully would be prohibitively expensive for a hobby project. Feel free to review the complexity of existing small independent solutions as an alternative.

## Production

### cesanta elk

* https://github.com/cesanta/elk
* supports a tiny subset of ES6 (numerous restrictions below ES1)
* implemented in: C

> Elk: a tiny JS engine for embedded systems. Does not use malloc. Operates with a given memory buffer only. Small footprint: about 20KB on flash/disk, about 100 bytes RAM for core VM. No bytecode. Interprets JS code directly.  Elk is completely bare, it does not even have a standard library.

### CL-JavaScript

* https://github.com/akapav/js
* https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/cl-javascript/
* license: MIT
* implemented in: Common Lisp

> CL-JavaScript allows you to add user scripting to your Common Lisp application without requiring your poor users to learn Common Lisp. It is a JavaScript to Common Lisp translator, runtime, and standard library. We are ECMAScript 3 compatible, with some of the ECMAScript 5 extensions.
> By using the Lisp compiler to compile JavaScript (and by using some clever tricks for the things that Lisp normally isn't good at), this implementation manages to be faster than most of the 2009 generation of JavaScript engines. The new generation (V8, JÃ¤germonkey) beats it by, depending on the benchmark, a factor 4 or so.

* license: MIT

### Kinoma XS6

* https://github.com/Kinoma/kinomajs
* https://www.moddable.com/XS7-TC-39

> Kinoma's XS6 library implements a JavaScript virtual machine optimized for devices with limited resources. This virtual machine conforms to the 6th edition of the ECMAScript specification (ECMAScript 2015).
> The Kinoma Porting Layer (KPL) is the bottom of the KinomaJS stack. It is a very light portability layer, modeled, as much as practical, on POSIX. Because KinomaJS runs on a wide variety of operating systems, the goal is to isolate all direct calls to the host operating in KPL. Some RTOS hosts do not support the full ANSI C library, so it cannot even be safely assumed that functions like printf are available. To avoid surprises with the size of types, a portable-type system modeled on that used by QuickTime is used.

### Ladybird LibJS

* formerly for SerenityOS LibWeb
* https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/tree/master/Userland/Libraries/LibJS
* used by Ladybird

### microvium

* https://github.com/coder-mike/microvium/blob/main/doc/supported-language.md#not-supported

* https://coder-mike.com/blog/2022/06/11/microvium-is-very-small/
* implemented in: C
* supports a small subset of ES3 with some ES6 features

> Microvium is a tiny JavaScript engine (less than 16kB compiled size) for microcontrollers for running a small but useful subset of the JavaScript language. The runtime engine is portable C code and easy to integrate. Microvium takes the unique approach partially running the JS code at build time and deploying a snapshot, which leads to a number of advantages over other embedded JavaScript engines.

* https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/golang-github-robertkrimen-otto-dev

> Package otto is a JavaScript parser and interpreter written natively in Go.
> Otto targets ES5
> Go translates JavaScript-style regular expressions into something that is "regexp" compatible via parser.TransformRegExp. Unfortunately, RegExp requires backtracking for some patterns, and backtracking is not supported by the standard Go engine. re2 (Go) has a different definition for \s: [\t\n\f\r ]
> Package natto is an example/offshoot of otto that implements an event loop (supporting setTimeout/setInterval).

> JavaScript-like language with optional templating
> The ucode language is a small, general-purpose scripting language that resembles ECMAScript syntax. It can be used as a standalone interpreter or embedded into host applications. Ucode supports template mode with control flow and expression logic statements embedded in Jinja-like markup blocks.
> The development of ucode was motivated by the need to rewrite the OpenWrt firewall framework using nftables. Initially intended as a template processor, ucode evolved into a versatile scripting language for various system scripting tasks. Its design goals include easy integration with C applications, efficient handling of JSON data and complex data structures, support for OpenWrt's ubus message bus system, and a comprehensive set of built-in functions inspired by Perl 5.

* implemented in: JavaScript ES5
* features: ES5
* license: MIT

> Both invasived and sandbox modes available. Based on parser Acorn.

## Planned

### gemiweb0

* The main scope is producing only documentation, specification and conformance tests. Developers are expected to implement it on their own.
* A proof of concept JavaScript0 interpreter plugin for gemini and web browsers and for CLI/CGI web server integration will be provided later in multiple languages, both low level and high level.
* Language: C, PHP, busybox ash & awk, JavaScript0

### Yavashark

* https://github.com/Sharktheone/yavashark
* features: JavaScript, TypeScript
* implemented in: Rust
* license: MIT

## Experimental

### bali

* https://github.com/ferus-web/bali
* implemented in: Nim with C++ dependencies
* used by: Ferus web engine, Basket Wayland launcher
* license: LGPLv3

> Bali is still not in a usable state yet and is probably unstable. It is not meant to be used in production for now. As of 9th of November, 2024, Bali can successfully run 1% of the entire Test262 suite
> With some recent codegen optimizations, Bali is already pretty fast on cherry-picked benchmarks. Bali can perform some optimizations when it is generating code for the provided JavaScript source, granted that it can prove that there is an opportunity to optimize away things. Bali has some loop elision optimizations in place which can fully eliminate an expensive loop when it sees the opportunity. It also has some rudimentary dead code elimination for some cases.

### boa

* https://github.com/boa-dev/boa
* implemented in Rust
* license: Unlicense or MIT

> Boa is an embeddable and experimental Javascript engine written in Rust. Currently, it has support for some of the language.

### Esprima .NET

Only a parser

* https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/ECMAScript.html
* approximately ES3 (not finished)

> It's probably not as fast as compilers that produce native code, but because it hooks into Guile's compiler at a high level, as Guile's compiler improves and eventually gets native code compilation, it will be plenty fast.

### Kiesel

* https://codeberg.org/kiesel-js/kiesel
* implemented in: Zig

> The implementation style is similar to LibJS - the JS engine used in SerenityOS and the Ladybird browser which I worked on before - in various aspects, most notably the desire to stay very close to spec. Development is still at an early stage and the engine's usefulness thus limited. While there are various things that already work well, there's an equal amount of things that don't :^)

### Nova

* https://github.com/trynova/nova
* implemented in: Rust
* license: MPL-2.0

> The execution model is currently greatly inspired by Kiesel and SerenityOS's LibJS. See the code for more details. Passing about 70% of the test262 test suite

### Toshok EchoJS

* https://github.com/toshok/echojs

> An ahead of time compiler and runtime for ES6. Things only build reliably on OSX. You'll need a couple of external dependencies to get things running: node.js, llvm 3.6, coffeescript

> This project aims to be an extremely simple (~2000 line) JavaScript interpreter, meant for inclusion in applications that require a simple, familiar script language that can be included with no dependencies other than normal C++ libraries. It currently consists of two source files: one containing the interpreter, another containing built-in functions such as String.substring.
> TinyJS is not designed to be fast or full-featured. However it is great for scripting simple behaviour, or loading & saving settings.
> I make absolutely no guarantees that this is compliant to JavaScript/EcmaScript standard. In fact I am sure it isn't. However I welcome suggestions for changes that will bring it closer to compliance without overly complicating the code, or useful test cases to add to the test suite.
> TinyJS uses a Recursive Descent Parser, so there is no 'Parser Generator' required. It does not compile to an intermediate code, and instead executes directly from source code. This makes it quite fast for code that is executed infrequently, and slow for loops.
> Variables, Arrays and Objects are stored in a simple linked list tree structure (42tiny-js uses a C++ Map). This is simple, but relatively slow for large structures or arrays.

### ToyLang

* https://github.com/evomassiny/toylang
* 2021
* Language: Rust

> This a toy programming language, utterly useless. I'm using it to experiment parser, compiler and interpreter designs
> keywords: function (only supports named function), while, for, if, else, return, let, null, undefined, continue, break
> operators: + - * / ** %, > < >= <= ==, ! && ||, ++foo foo++ --foo foo--
> separators: ; for expressions, ( ) for sub-expressions, { }
> literals: booleans, float/integers, strings

* 2012

> Narcissus is a JavaScript interpreter written in pure JavaScript (i.e., a meta-circular evaluator), using the SpiderMonkey engine.
> Originally a proof-of-concept, a test-bed for rapidly prototyping new language features for the JavaScript language (as well as the ECMAScript standard).

### ohmjs ecmascript

Only a parser:

* https://github.com/ohmjs/ohm/blob/main/examples/ecmascript/README.md
* https://github.com/ohmjs/ohm/blob/main/examples/ecmascript/src/es5.ohm

> Ohm grammars for various versions of the ECMAScript spec. Based on Tom Van Cutsem's ES5 parser from the es-lab project. Currently, only the ES5 grammar is reasonably complete, but we are working on ES6.
